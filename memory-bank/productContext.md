# Product Context: Flutter3D Rendering Engine

## Problem Space

*   Flutter's built-in 3D capabilities are limited.
*   Existing community solutions (e.g., `flutter_gl`) may be outdated, lack comprehensive platform support, or don't leverage the latest, most performant graphics APIs (Metal, Vulkan, DX12, WebGPU).
*   Developers wanting to integrate advanced 3D graphics into Flutter apps face significant hurdles in managing platform-specific rendering code and bridging it to Dart.

## Target Audience

*   Flutter developers who need to incorporate 3D graphics, visualizations, games, or interactive experiences into their applications.
*   Developers looking for a performant, modern, and unified way to handle 3D rendering across multiple platforms within the Flutter ecosystem.

## Desired User Experience

*   **Simplicity:** Developers should be able to integrate and use the 3D rendering capabilities through a clean, intuitive Dart API without needing deep expertise in each native graphics API.
*   **Performance:** Rendering should be efficient, leveraging the power of the underlying native APIs to enable complex scenes and smooth frame rates.
*   **Cross-Platform Consistency:** While leveraging native performance, the API should provide a consistent developer experience across all supported platforms.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for future expansion with more advanced rendering features (e.g., PBR materials, advanced lighting, physics integration hooks).
