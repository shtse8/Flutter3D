# Progress: Flutter3D Rendering Engine

## Current Status

*   **Overall:** Project setup complete. Starting Web/WebGPU backend implementation.
*   **Date:** 2025-04-02

## What Works

*   Project planning completed (`planning_notes.md`).
*   Memory Bank structure initialized with core files (`memory-bank/`).

*   Native backend adapters (starting with Web/WebGPU).
*   Shader handling system.
*   Asset loading.
*   Advanced rendering features (lighting, shadows, etc.).

*   Documentation and examples.

## Known Issues / Blockers
