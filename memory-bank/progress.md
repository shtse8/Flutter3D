# Progress: Flutter3D Rendering Engine

## Current Status

*   **Overall:** Basic Web/WebGPU pipeline structure implemented. Ready for initial testing.
*   **Date:** 2025-04-02

## What Works

*   Project planning completed (`planning_notes.md`).
*   Memory Bank structure initialized with core files (`memory-bank/`).
*   Flutter plugin project structure created (`flutter_3d/`).
*   Initial Dart API classes defined (`flutter_3d/lib/flutter_3d.dart`).
*   Placeholder test files updated.
*   Created initial JS backend (`flutter_3d/web/flutter_3d_webgpu.js`).
*   Created Dart web interop bridge (`flutter_3d/lib/flutter_3d_web.dart`).
*   Updated example app (`flutter_3d/example/`) to load JS and attempt WebGPU initialization/canvas clearing.

## What's Left To Build (High Level)

*   Dart API **implementation** (connecting to web backend).
*   Platform bridge implementation (refining JS-interop).
*   Actual drawing logic in WebGPU (triangles, meshes).
*   Native backend adapters (starting with Web/WebGPU).
*   Shader handling system.
*   Asset loading.
*   Advanced rendering features (lighting, shadows, etc.).
*   Performance optimization.
*   Build system setup.
*   Documentation and examples.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   None at this stage.
