# Progress: Flutter3D Rendering Engine

## Current Status

*   **Overall:** Static triangle rendering via Dart API working on WebGPU backend. Matrix transformations paused due to rendering issues.
*   **Date:** 2025-04-03

## What Works

*   Project planning completed (`planning_notes.md`).
*   Memory Bank structure initialized with core files (`memory-bank/`).
*   Flutter plugin project structure created (`flutter_3d/`).
*   Initial Dart API classes defined (`flutter_3d/lib/flutter_3d.dart`).
*   Placeholder test files updated.
*   Created JS backend (`flutter_3d/example/web/flutter_3d_webgpu.js`) with mesh setup and rendering logic.
*   Created Dart web interop bridge (`flutter_3d/lib/flutter_3d_web.dart`) and fixed `setProperty` usage.
*   Updated core Dart API (`flutter_3d/lib/flutter_3d.dart`) to handle mesh data and drive rendering.
*   Added stub files for conditional imports.
*   Updated example app (`flutter_3d/example/`) to use core Dart API for rendering.
*   Optimized mesh buffer uploads in `Renderer`.
## What's Left To Build (High Level)

*   Dart API **implementation** (connecting to web backend).
*   Debug/Fix matrix transformations.
*   Implement texture mapping.
*   Flesh out Material/Shader API.
*   Native backend adapters (starting with Web/WebGPU).
*   Shader handling system.
*   Asset loading.
*   Advanced rendering features (lighting, shadows, etc.).
*   Performance optimization.
*   Build system setup.
*   Documentation and examples.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   Matrix transformations cause blank screen despite seemingly correct setup (WebGPU). Reverted code to static rendering baseline (commit `e2cf173`). Debugging paused.
